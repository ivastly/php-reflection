# PHP Reflection

## Rationale
Ever questioned yourself why you need to write more than a single line of code to get a value of private property?
What if the property is defined in a parent class? 
Please welcome a library to solve this trouble once and for all.

## Functionality
- Read value of any property of an object, including parent classes, with a single call.
- Find out the visibility of a property, including parent classes, with a single call.
- Check if a property exists in a class.
